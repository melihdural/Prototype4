This project was carried out as part of the "unity junior programer pathway". Throughout the project, the following game mechanics were practiced.

## Until Now!

* We defined mobility for the player and moved the camera to determine the direction of movement.
 
* Enemy Control and SpawnManager scripts were created.
 
* Added powerup feature for player.
 
* Spawn conditions set for powerup system

* Adjusted the behavior of the enemy object when it collides with the player while the powerup system is active

* The system that destroy the enemies when they fall from the platform has been created.

* A loop that allows enemies to multiply and respawn after they die has been created. 

* The powerup system is formed depending on the number of enemies.
